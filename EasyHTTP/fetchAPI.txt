There was nothing untoward in the way Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was treated the day she was arrested, said Crown lawyers in Vancouver Monday.

Meng was back in a Vancouver courtroom to start the week as lawyers representing the attorney general of Canada began their submissions in a battle over the disclosure of documents ahead of the Chinese tech executive’s extradition trial set for January.

Meng’s lawyers have argued that Canadian officials colluded with their U.S. counterparts, and that Canada Border Service Agency (CBSA) officers and the RCMP carried out a “covert criminal investigation” against her while she was detained at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1, 2018.

Guards held Meng for three hours before RCMP executed a provisional arrest warrant at the request of the United States, which is trying to extradite her for allegedly violating sanctions against Iran.

On Monday, Crown lawyer Robert Frater again characterized Meng’s requests for documents as a “fishing expedition.”

Frater said Meng underwent a routine secondary screening, and the questions CBSA officers asked her, including her business dealings and residences in Vancouver, are well within the agency’s mandate.

Frater said the wait between Meng’s detention and her arrest was simply the RCMP waiting for CBSA officials to finish their job before stepping in to do their own.
